# CBMplugs

These plugins are modified from [David Weinehall's original cbmplugs-1.2.0 sources](http://www.acc.umu.se/~tao/files/linux/cbmplugs/) that have been floating around untouched for the last 15 years.

An alternative GIMP palette (Commodore64-c64wiki.gpl) has been included aswell.

## Original README

These plugins for The GIMP v1.2/v2.0 are to be used for importing and
exporting images from/to the Commodore 64. See the file imageformats.txt
for details on what file formats are supported.

A GIMP palette (Commodore64.gpl) which tries to imitate the colours of
the Commodore 64 as closely as possible is also included.

Ideas and part of the implementation is based on the
Koala Painter plugin by Maurits Rijk, written in 1999 for The GIMP v1.0.
